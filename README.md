# Museum App

This repository hosts a project being developed for the MGA 672 â€“ Developing Interactive Systems course, by Daniel Werle and Irina Ganevica.

Our project will create an universal Museum app, that will enrich visitor's experiences when visiting museums, allowing people to play a bingo game by searching required objects and getting points.

Application prototype is planned to be run on mobile platform. As a development tool we decided to use https://creator.ionic.io , because it is made for mobile app creation, and from our perspective is the best choice to make a prototype. 

As export file this tool provides ZIP archieve.  The .zip will contain the HTML/CSS/JS files of our project, separated into standard organizational format.
