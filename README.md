# Museum App

This repository hosts a project being developed for the MGA 672 â€“ Developing Interactive Systems course, by Daniel Werle and Irina Ganevica.

Our project will create an universal Museum app, that will enrich visitor's experiences when visiting museums, allowing educators to better plan group visits, tourists to make the most of their time in the museum, and friends to play together. The app will make use of Google Maps's API and a proprietary API for consuming artwork information, hosted on Firebase.

For tourists, the app will create a personalized route inside the museum according to the visitor's available time and the museum's highlights.

Application prototype is planned to be run on mobile platform. As a development tool we decided to use https://creator.ionic.io , because it is made for mobile app creation, and from our perspective is the best choice to make a prototype. 

As export file this tool provides ZIP archieve.  The .zip will contain the HTML/CSS/JS files of our project, separated into standard organizational format.
